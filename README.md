# Pete's Pet Emporium!

This is the starter project of the Pete's Pet tutorial.

## Tasks

### Simple Search & Pagination
Add a search bar in the navbar to search pets. Paginate the results.

### Validations
Add validations to protect against unsanitary data getting into your db.
Validations can happen at four places:

4. In the database
Most validations happen at the client and model levels.
